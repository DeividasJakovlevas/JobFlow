# JobFlow
Java Spring + Angular practice project

I created this project to practice fullstack development with Java Spring Boot and Angular framework. 
The app allows users to look up job listings and press next when they want to see another one.

Currently it has no tests and only part of planned functionality works as can be seen from the frontend. 

# Tech Stack

Java Spring Boot, Angular, H2 memory stored database, JPA

# Running

To run the app, first run the spring boot application with Intellij or other IDE, then navigate to resources/static/frontend in the terminal and type 
`ng serve`
This will have the angular application running on localhost:4200 and it should make calls to spring app
